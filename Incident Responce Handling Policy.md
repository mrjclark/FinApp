# Incident Response Handling Policy

## 1. Purpose & Scope
This policy defines the incident response process for the Personal Finance App, ensuring timely detection, assessment, and resolution of security incidents. Since all incidents are identified through self-assessment or automated testing, the response workflow is designed for individual execution.

Scope:
- Applies to security incidents affecting application integrity, data security, system availability, and authentication mechanisms.
- Incorporates impact vs. likelihood matrix for risk evaluation.
- Covers incident tracking, resolution, and documentation.

## 2. Incident Classification

### 2.1 Severity Levels
Incidents are classified based on impact vs. likelihood evaluation:

| Severity | Impact | Likelihood | Action |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| Critical | High | High | Immediate response, containment, and remediation required. |
| High | High | Low | Prioritized response with mitigation strategies. |
| Medium | Low | High | Address issue promptly; monitor for recurrence. |
| Low | Low | Low | Log and review periodically; apply fixes if necessary. |

### 2.2 Incident Types
- Authentication failures – Unauthorized access attempts.
- Data integrity violations – Unexpected data modifications or corruption.
- System availability issues – Downtime, excessive latency, or crashes.
- Security control deviations – Failure in encryption, access control, or validation mechanisms.

## 3. Incident Response Workflow

### 3.1 Detection & Identification
- Review automated security test results and manual assessments.
- Identify patterns of abnormal behavior or failed security checks.

### 3.2 Containment & Investigation
- Isolate affected components to prevent further impact.
- Conduct root cause analysis using application logs and error reports.
- Assess risks based on the impact vs. likelihood matrix.

### 3.3 Resolution & Mitigation
- Apply hotfixes or patches where necessary.
- Adjust configurations to reinforce security controls.
- Modify security testing parameters to prevent recurrence.

### 3.4 Documentation & Review
- Log incident details, including:
  - Issue description
  - Detection method
  - Risk classification
  - Actions taken
  - Resolution outcome
- Conduct periodic review sessions to assess improvements.

## 4. Continuous Monitoring & Improvement
- Integrate additional automated security tests to refine detection.
- Perform trend analysis on past incidents to enhance response strategies.
- Update risk evaluation methodologies based on emerging threats.

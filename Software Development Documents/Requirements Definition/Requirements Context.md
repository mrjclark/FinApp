## 2. Stakeholder Map
| Stakeholder Map | Stakeholder | Role / Interest | Influence Level | Contact / Representation | 
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------| 
| Internal Security Team | Define and validate security controls | High | | Create cyber resiliency objectives to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to threats
| Compliance Officer | Ensure regulatory alignment | High | | 
| End Users | Users of FinApp for intended purposes | Medium | | 
| Third-Party Vendors | Provide integrated services or libraries | Medium | |

## 3. Mission & Ethical Commitments 
- All requirements will directly support policy laid out by the FinApp leadership team.  
- Data will only be requested and never gathered without consent (NIST AR‑4; CIS 3.4; OWASP Privacy Risks Project).
- All processing will follow data minimization principles (NIST PL‑8; CIS 3.4; OWASP ASVS 9.1).
- All trade-offs will have an impact identified that takes into account time added to development caused by performance impact to internal teams, and CIA impact to end users. Weighting will be given at 40% for time added to 60% for CIA impact. CIA impact will be translated into a time estimate such that it recognizes the time a user will spend remediating issues, or requesting fixes. 
 

## 4. Assumptions 
- GitHub will be the primary code repository, with the main branch matching the latest release version
- For prototypes 
    - Prototypes must be able to pass integration tests, unit tests, and security tests before deployment (NIST SA‑11; CIS 16.13; OWASP ASVS 14.2).
    - Languages will be identified as any secure and mature language the contributor is proficient in. Prototypes must be able to pass integration tests, unit tests, code quality checks, secret scanning tests, 
    - Databases will be identified as compatible with the prototyping language will be used. Databases must be able to pass integration tests, and must must be secured in accordance with integration testing complexity requirements (NIST SC‑28; CIS 3.11; OWASP ASVS 9.1).
- For releases :
    - Languages will include requirements from prototyping languages as well as be restricted to performant, memory safe languages. These will include C#, JavaScript, Go and Rust.
    - Databases will be mature, open-source, and secure. These will include PostgreSQL.

## 8. Risk Tolerance & Initial Assessment 
See [Initial Organization Risk Assessment](../Concepts\ and\ Assessment/Initiation\ Organizational\ Risk\ Assessment.md)
Risk Appetite Statement: Based on the initial risk assessment, the project will not accept risk that increases the time to recover by more than 12 hours. This will ensure that contributors are unencumbered by low criticality remediation, but users will be protected from vulnerabilities that directly conflict with project goals. 

## 9. Monitoring, Detection, and Response Requirements
- All logs must be protected from unauthorized access or modification (NIST AU‑9; CIS 8.2; OWASP ASVS 1.13).
- Audit records must be retained for the defined compliance period (NIST AU‑11; CIS 8.2; OWASP ASVS 1.13).
- Incident response procedures must define severity levels and escalation paths (NIST IR‑4, IR‑6; CIS 17.1; OWASP ASVS 1.13).
- All monitoring will be done with logging to begin with. This means that all actions performed by prototypes, releases, tests, and security systems must provide detailed event logs. Logging message format is covered in [Central Logging Format](../../Governance/Procedures/Central\ Logging\ Format.md)
- Log reviews will be done daily to look for issues in third party components or build pipeline issues. 
- Responses will be done on a per-availability basis. When a contributor is able to attend to an open issue, this will be worked on before further development is done.

## 10. Supply Chain & Third-Party Requirements 
- All third‑party components must be actively maintained and have a proven security patch history (NIST SA‑22, SI‑2; CIS 2.3; OWASP ASVS 14.2.4).
- All third-party components must have a risk assessment done. Criteria for passing will be based on component maturity, community support, and vulnerabilities' time to remediate within the past year. An component will not be used if it fails two of the following portions of the assessment:
    - The component was released less than 6 months prior to the assessment
    - There is no official community support
    - Vulnerabilities take longer than 1 month to patch
- A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) must be maintained and updated with each release (NIST SSDF PS.3.1; CIS 2.3; OWASP ASVS 14.2.4).
- Vulnerabilities discovered in third-party components must be documented within 3 days as an issue. 
- All packages must be signed and verified before use (NIST SA‑12, SA‑19; CIS 2.3; OWASP ASVS 14.2.4).


## 11. Traceability & Version Control 
- All requirements will be tagged with unique IDs. Naming convention format is covered in [Naming Conventions](../../Governance/Procedures/Naming\ Conventions.md) 
- Changes logged in Git messages must contain the following:
    - A concise subject line with written in the imperative mood
    - A body that explains why the change was done, what problem or issue it solved, how it was done, and the issue number it addresses, if applicable. 
    - Git messages should be consistently worded and formatted according to each contributor's preferred style and lexicon.
- All requirements must be traceable to implementation and test components (NIST CM‑3; CIS 4.1; OWASP SAMM Governance).
- Version control must be enforced for all source code and configuration files (NIST CM‑8; CIS 4.1; OWASP SAMM Governance).

## 12. API Security
- API's will require identification, authentication, and authorization to be performed for all system to system or user to system interaction.

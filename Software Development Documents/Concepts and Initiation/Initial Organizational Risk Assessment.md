# High-Level Risk Assessment

## Purpose
## Tier 1 Initial Risk Assessment Purpose Statement
This initial Tier 1 risk assessment aims to identify strategic threats, threat sources, and systemic vulnerabilities that may impact the decentralized development and stewardship of our personal finance and budgeting application. As the first formal risk evaluation for this project, it establishes a baseline understanding of organizational risk posture, informs symbolic governance and contributor onboarding, and guides the prioritization of security and privacy controls. The assessment aligns with NIST SP 800-37 and SP 800-30 guidance, supporting risk-informed decision-making and laying the foundation for continuous monitoring and future Tier 2 and Tier 3 assessments.

## Scope
This Tier 1 risk assessment applies to the entire decentralized development project for the personal finance and budgeting application. It encompasses all assets produced during development, including source code, documentation, contributor workflows, and governance artifacts.

The assessment evaluates strategic risks associated with:
- Software development practices and lifecycle transitions
- Small team dynamics and contributor onboarding
- Handling and storage of personal financial data

The scope includes both security and privacy risks, in alignment with NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 and SP 800-37 Rev. 2. It supports organizational-level decision-making, control selection, and symbolic stewardship rituals.

This assessment remains valid for one (1) year from approval unless one or more of the following conditions occur:
- The project transitions from development to operational deployment
- The contributor team exceeds ten (10) personnel
- The project begins handling or storing data types beyond personal financial data

Any of these changes will trigger a reassessment to ensure continued alignment with RMF guidance and evolving risk posture.

## Assumptions and Constraints
### Assumptions
- Threat actors are expected to be less capable and primarily opportunistic, rather than targeted or persistent.
- All contributors will adhere to formal code review protocols and automated code scanning requirements.
- Contributors are assumed to be self-motivated to internalize and uphold project values, including symbolic governance rituals.
- Third-party contributions will undergo additional risk assessments prior to integration.
- Contributors will maintain stable access to infrastructure, tooling, and communication channels.
- Personally identifiable information (PII) will be minimized; names, emails, and other identifiers will not be collected.
- Personal financial information (PFI) will exclude bank credentials or sensitive financial identifiers; all data will be operational in nature.
- Contributors will be required to sign commits and use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for audits and peer reviews.
- No formal legal or regulatory oversight is expected during development; internal audits will serve as the primary assurance mechanism.
- Governance rituals and stewardship protocols will be introduced during onboarding and reaffirmed annually

### Constraints
- Time for initial implementation and risk assessment is limited to one (1) week.
- Personnel is currently limited to a single steward; expansion to ten (10) contributors will materially affect the risk posture.
- Tooling and automation capabilities will be constrained by the technical proficiency of contributors.
- External consultations will only be pursued through available, no-cost services or community support.
- Contributors will be responsible for implementing and maintaining assigned controls.
- Governance authority resides solely with the project owner; all decisions, rituals, and standards are stewarded centrally.
- Data will be classified (e.g., operational, symbolic, audit-relevant) and handled according to predefined protocols.
- The project must remain open-source; no monetization of this project or derivative works will be permitted.

## Threats
### Threats Derived from Assumptions

1. Underestimated Threat Actor Capability
- Assumption: Threat actors are opportunistic and less capable.
- Threat: A more sophisticated attacker targets the app due to its open-source nature or symbolic visibility.

2. Contributor Misalignment or Burnout
- Assumption: Contributors are self-motivated to uphold values.
- Threat: Misalignment with governance rituals or contributor disengagement leads to inconsistent control implementation or symbolic drift.

3. Third-Party Component Risk
- Assumption: All third-party contributions will be vetted.
- Threat: A dependency is integrated before full vetting, introducing vulnerabilities or licensing conflicts.

4. Stable Access Disruption
- Assumption: Contributors have stable access.
- Threat: Infrastructure outages, contributor relocation, or account lockouts disrupt development or audits.

5. Minimal PII and PFI Exposure
- Assumption: No sensitive identifiers or bank data will be collected.
- Threat: A misconfigured form or logging mechanism inadvertently captures sensitive data.

### Threats Derived from Constraints

6. Single Steward Bottleneck
- Constraint: Only one person conducting the assessment.
- Threat: Blind spots in threat modeling, limited validation, or delayed response to emerging risks.

7. Team Growth Impact
- Constraint: Risk posture changes at 10+ contributors.
- Threat: Rapid onboarding without governance alignment introduces insider risk or control gaps.

8. Limited Tooling and Automation
- Constraint: Technical knowledge limits automation.
- Threat: Manual processes fail to detect vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or audit gaps.

9. Free-Only External Consultation
- Constraint: Only free services will be used.
- Threat: Lack of expert validation or delayed response to high-risk findings due to resource constraints.

10. Contributor-Control Dependency
- Constraint: Contributors must implement controls.
- Threat: Controls are inconsistently applied or misunderstood, especially in symbolic or emotional domains.

11. Open-Source Exposure
- Constraint: Project must remain open-source and non-monetized.
- Threat: Public visibility increases attack surface; lack of monetization may limit incentives for long-term maintenance.

### Threat Sources
Based on the threats from the assumptions and constraints, the likely sources of threat to the project will be as follows:

#### Adversarial
- Opportunistic attackers targeting open-source or financial applications
- Malicious insiders or disgruntled contributors
- Supply chain risks from compromised third-party libraries or dependencies
- Credential stuffing or brute-force attempts against contributor accounts

#### Accidental
- Contributor misconfiguration or commit errors
- Failure to follow onboarding or governance rituals
- Unintended data exposure due to logging, form design, or misused variables
- Overly permissive access controls or forgotten cleanup steps

#### Structural

- Limited external consultation and tooling due to resource constraints
- High reliance on contributor self-motivation and governance adherence
- No formal legal or regulatory oversight to enforce compliance
- Project philosophy prohibits monetization, reducing incentives for long-term maintenance

### Likelihood of Exploitations

#### Quantitative Risk Estimation Methodology
Likelihood estimates for identified risk scenarios are derived using probabilistic modeling techniques outlined in *How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk* by Douglas W. Hubbard and Richard Seiersen (Wiley, 2nd Edition, 2023). This approach emphasizes calibrated expert judgment, Bayesian inference, and Monte Carlo simulation to quantify uncertainty and improve decision accuracy.

### Analytic Approach
This risk assessment will use a quantitative approach based on a vulnerability-oriented approach. The purpose is to ensure the proper controls to be designed to meet policy needs

## Information Sources
Information sources will be external to the project. Information for this initial risk assessment has come entirely from the *NIST Special Publication 800-30 revision 1*.

## Risk Model and Analytic Approach
This Tier 1 risk assessment employs a vulnerability-oriented risk model, consistent with NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guidance. The analytic approach is quantitative, leveraging probabilistic estimation techniques outlined in *How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk* by Hubbard and Seiersen. This includes calibrated expert judgment, Bayesian inference, and Monte Carlo simulation to quantify uncertainty and support risk-informed governance decisions.

## Risk Assessment

### Identify Threat Sources

Threat sources were derived from documented assumptions and constraints, then refined to reflect adversarial, accidental, structural, and environmental origins. These include:

- Adversarial: Opportunistic attackers, malicious insiders, supply chain compromise, credential stuffing.
- Accidental: Misconfigurations, commit errors, onboarding missteps, unintended data exposure.
- Structural: Tooling failures, dependency fragility, governance bottlenecks.
- Environmental: Infrastructure outages, contributor availability disruptions, climate-related degradation.

Threat sources were updated to reflect evolving project visibility, contributor dynamics, and symbolic governance exposure, in accordance with NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 Section 3.2.4.

### Identify Threat Events

Threat events were mapped to threat sources and include:

- Exploitation of misconfigured systems or roles
- Credential-based attacks (e.g., brute force, session hijacking)
- Supply chain compromise via third-party libraries
- Insider bypass of symbolic or technical controls
- Denial of service targeting CI/CD pipelines
- Exfiltration of sensitive artifacts (e.g., API keys, audit logs)

These events were selected based on relevance to decentralized development, open-source exposure, and symbolic governance rituals.

### Identify Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities were identified through analysis of contributor workflows, governance protocols, and technical constraints:

- Lack of automated dependency scanning
- Absence of secrets management and token rotation
- Limited access reviews and role separation
- Overreliance on symbolic governance without enforcement
- Incomplete validation of third-party contributions
- Small team size and operational redundancy gaps

Vulnerabilities were prioritized based on exploitability and potential impact on auditability, contributor trust, and symbolic integrity.

### Determine Likelihood of Occurrence

Likelihood estimates were derived using a quantitative, probabilistic approach based on How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk:

- Calibrated expert judgment was used to estimate ranges for threat event frequency and vulnerability exploitability.
- Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulation were applied to model uncertainty and generate defensible likelihood distributions.
- This approach supports continuous refinement and aligns with NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 Appendix G guidance.

### Determine Magnitude of Impact

Impacts were assessed across five domains:

- Individuals: Loss of PII/PFI, reputational harm
- Mission: Contributor misalignment, audit failure
- Operations: Development disruption, noncompliance
- Assets: Loss/corruption of audit artifacts, unauthorized modification of standards
- External Stakeholders: Credibility loss, exposure of sensitive governance artifacts

Impact magnitude was estimated using probabilistic modeling and symbolic traceability, supporting risk-informed control selection.

### Determine Risk

Risk was calculated by integrating likelihood and impact estimates for each scenario:

- Risk scenarios were modeled using Monte Carlo simulation to produce probabilistic distributions of expected loss.
- Scenarios were ranked by expected value and tail risk to inform control prioritization.
- Results will guide symbolic governance updates, contributor onboarding rituals, and control implementation.

This risk determination supports Tier 1 strategic decision-making and lays the foundation for future Tier 2 and Tier 3 assessments.

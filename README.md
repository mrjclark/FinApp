# FinApp

FinApp is a personal finance application designed as a portfolio and training project for secure software development and information security best practices.  
The intent of this project is to:

- Demonstrate secure-by-design software principles in alignment with industry standards (NIST SSDF, OWASP, CIS Controls, ISO/IEC 27001).
- Serve as a transparent example of governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) documentation and implementation.
- Advance personal proficiency in information security, privacy engineering, and secure architecture.
- Provide reference materials and methodologies for educational and noncommercial research purposes.

For details on governance, security commitments, and compliance, see the [Information Security Policy](./Information%20Security%20Policy.md).

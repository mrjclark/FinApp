- Retire or decommission components securely, ensuring data sanitization.
- Update documentation, threat models, and risk assessments.
- Review and improve security controls based on lessons learned.
- Ensure secure transfer or destruction of sensitive data and assets.
- Maintain documentation and assurance cases.
- Intentionally reflect on lessons learned and refine processes.


### 3.2 Supply Chain Management
- SecOps contributors will established a process to ensure that all third party assets (TPA) are controlled. Any vulnerabilities that are inherent in the TPA will be identified. Controls will be put into place to ensure that risks due to TPAs are reduced.
- All TPAs will require to undergo a vetting process before implementation to ensure that the security and privacy needs of the project are met. Origin, integrity, and supplier claims must be tested and confirmed. 
- FinApp design must tolerate any supplier failure or compromise.
- Every release must include a validated SBOM. Any vulnerabilities arising from TPAs must be tracked and remediated within one (1) week. Affected releases will be pulled if any vulnerabilities from TPAs that are known to be exploited outside of research.

### 3.3 Developer Access Control Management
All access control as per the S01 Access Control Implementation Standards.md are still applicable. If excess, the following access standards are implemented to any individual who will have access to development environments.
- Developers will have specific access to view, modify, and remove portions of the code base and workflows related to their code in non-production environments and branches. 
- Access to specific files will be role based. 
- No other role will have direct access to code base.
- Role authorization will be granted by a Development Lead or Project Lead. Access control decisions must be documented and traceable to role based authorization policies.
- Developers will not have access to modify access levels of their own or other roles, project security objects, or governance.
- Developers will not have access to modify or remove code or workflows from the production environment or branch.
- Developer commits will need to be verified.
- Developer access will be removed per Human Resources Standards.

### 3.4 Securing Sensitive Data
Data classified as sensitive as per the SXX Data Classification Standards.md will have the following additional standards applied:
- All sensitive data transference within FinApp will be logged in an auditable, immutable, local and centralized area.
- All sensitive data will have cryptographic measures applied when leaving the bounds of FinApp.
- All data flows will be explicitly authorized and constrained by design. This will be done by identifying trust zone, establishing flow control designs between zones, and require boundary enforcement mechanisms.
- Regular scanning for API keys, authorization token, environment secrets, and project contributor PII will be performed. Upon detection, the Project Lead and DevSecOps Lead will be notified. Any releases containing this information will be pulled until all information leakage has been handled.
- Sensitive data flows must be documented in data flow diagrams and reviewed annually, or upon data flow changes.

### 3.5 Contributor Verifications
In the event that the FinApp project team exceeds ten (10) people, or should the FinApp project be reorganized to handle sensitive data, the following Contributor Verification program will be activated that will contain the following minimum standards:
- A segregation of duty review will be performed to separate privileged accesses from being able to develop and deploy code
- A review of all roles will be done to ensure that there is the least privileges needed to perform the duties
- Auditing procedures will be reviewed to ensure that it can identify contributor actions
- A senior contributor will be elected as the Responsible Steward to oversee monitoring. The Responsible Steward must maintain a log of privileged actions and review anomolies monthly.
- Scrutiny will be placed on actions that are deemed to misuse privileged access, bypass established controls, undermine project confidentiality and integrity goals, and cause any discord in project operations or team collaboration.

### 3.6 System Exposure Considerations
- All system boundaries must be documented in system diagrams and reviewed annually, or upon relevant subsystem changes.
- All communication within the project team will occur over approved channels
- FinApp subsystems will be separated from each other through logical divisions
- The code base will be regularly and automatically scanned for vulnerabilities that may expose the system to degradation of the FinApp's confidentiality or integrity. Any scans that successfully find a vulnerability must be acknowledged and action must be taken to handle the vulnerability.
- To the extent possible, review port and repository scans that are coming from unfamiliar locations. Persistent, unknown activity is to be blocked from the project.
- The code base will be regularly and automatically scanned for vulnerabilities that may expose the system to degradation of the FinApp's confidentiality or integrity.
- A complete and accurate list of the system inventory, including TPAs, project developed code, documentation, workflows, and security architecture will be kept and updated regularly, or upon change. If a system inventory reconciliation shows unaccounted for items, a review of the new items will take place to determine the origin, risk, and removal of the item. If the item is from an unknown origin, a change of environment secrets, API keys, access keys and signing will be completed where necessary.

### 3.5 Incident Handling with New Vulnerabilities
- Any recently reported vulnerabilities will be identified, logged, and a plan for correction will be determined.
- Any releases containing a vulnerability will be tagged and communicated to all stakeholders.
- Remediation of the flaw documented along with any potential side effects.
- Remediations will be incorporated into automatic testing and release deployment.

### 3.6 General Coding Standards
- All coding standards from the [OWASP Secure Coding](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/stable-en/02-checklist/05-checklist) Practices will be upheld.
- All contributors must complete secure coding checks as part of all pull requests.

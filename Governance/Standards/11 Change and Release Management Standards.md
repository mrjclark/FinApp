# Change and Release Management Standards

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This standard defines the minimum requirements for managing changes and releases within FinApp systems to ensure operational continuity, security, and auditability. It reflects FinApp’s commitment to intentional stewardship, contributor clarity, and governance.

### 1.2 Scope
Applies to all FinApp environments, systems, applications, infrastructure, and contributors involved in initiating, reviewing, approving, or deploying changes and releases.

| Owner | Establishes and enforces the standard. Reviews and approves exceptions. |
| Contributors | Implements tasks aligned to the standard. Escalates deviations. |
| Change Owner | Submits change requests, performs impact analysis, coordinates testing. |
| CAB (Change Advisory Board) | Reviews and authorizes changes based on risk and readiness. |
| Release Manager | Coordinates deployment, rollback planning, and post-release validation. |
| Security Steward | Ensures changes comply with secure development and deployment standards. |
| DevOps Contributor | Maintains traceability, logs, and evidence for compliance reviews. |

- Annual review of change management process is required.

### 3.2 Release Management
- Approved changes must be bundled into release packages with assigned tags.
- Releases must follow secure CI/CD practices.
- Deployment must include rollback plans and post-release validation.
- Post-release reviews must be conducted and documented.
- Release hygiene must follow OWASP Secure Deployment Cheat Sheet.
- Contributors must reflect on release outcomes using symbolic cue cards.

## 4. Implementation Guidance

## 5. Exceptions

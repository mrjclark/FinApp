# Incident Handling Standards 

## 1. Purpose & Scope
### 1.1 Purpose
To establish a unified incident handling framework that addresses confidentiality and integrity threats using threat centric modeling, and a service managment mindset to handle availability disruptions.

### 1.2 Scope
Applies to all system components, contributors, and environments governed by FinApp. Includes both security incidents and service disruptions.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities
| Role                  | Responsibilities                                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Owner                 | Enforces lifecycle rigor across CIA domains. Approves exceptions.   |
| Contributors          | Detect, report, and respond to incidents. Maintain traceability.    |
| Incident Response Lead| Coordinates containment, eradication, and recovery.                |
| Service Manager       | Restores availability, manages SLA impact, and RCA.                |

## 3. Standard Requirements
### 3.1 Unified Incident Lifecycle
All incidents follow a modular lifecycle:

| Phase                   | Action                                                        |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Detection & Identification | Monitor for anomalous packages, service degradation, or unauthorized access |
| Triage & Classification    | Score impact on CIA and SLA; tag as SEC, SVC, or ANOM       | 
| Containment & Mitigation   | Isolate compromised systems or reroute service              |
| Eradication & Recovery     | Remove threats, restore integrity, and resume service       |
| Post-Incident Review       | Document lessons, update controls, and reflect symbolically |

### 3.2 Confidentiality & Integrity Response 
- Implement automated detection of anomalous packages and unauthorized access
- Assign roles for information spill response and containment
- Train contributors on spill protocols
- Maintain traceable logs and forensic artifacts for audit

### 3.3 Availability Response
- Monitor service health and SLA thresholds
- Escalate service incidents via automated mechanisms
- Restore availability using predefined workaround and recovery protocols
- Conduct root cause analysis and service improvement rituals

### 3.4 Tagging 
Incident tags:
- SEC: Confidentiality or Integrity threat
- SVC: Availability disruption
- ANOM: Operational anomaly

## 4. Implementation Guidance
- Use SIEM and service desk integrations for detection
- Maintain markdown-based runbooks for each incident tier
- Automate tagging and artifact collection for audit traceability

## 5. Exceptions
- Exceptions must be documented, risk-assessed, and approved.
- Reviewed at least annually.  

## 6. Review & Maintenance
- Reviewed annually or upon significant changes.

## 7. References
- NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (IR controls): IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, IR-8
- NIST SP 800-61 (Incident Response Guide): Sections 2.4–3.4
- COBIT 2019 : DSS01–DSS03, MEA03

## 8. Audit & Traceability
- Compliance is verified through periodic reviews of implementation artifacts.
- Contributors may be asked to attest to adherence via signed commits or onboarding checklists.

### A. Definitions
## Terms and Definitions

| Term                   | Definition |
|------------------------|------------|
| Incident               | An unplanned event that disrupts normal system operations, compromises confidentiality, integrity, or availability, or signals anomalous behavior requiring investigation. |
| Security Incident (SEC) | An event that threatens the confidentiality or integrity of systems or data, including unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or anomalous package behavior. Governed by NIST SP 800-53 IR controls and SP 800-61 guidance. |
| Service Incident (SVC) | An event that disrupts the availability or performance of a service, such as system outages, failed deployments, or degraded response times. Governed by COBIT DSS processes. |
| Operational Anomaly (ANOM) | A deviation from expected system behavior that may not immediately impact CIA or SLA but signals potential risk or drift. Includes latency spikes, configuration mismatches, or unexplained alerts. |
| SLA (Service Level Agreement) | A formalized commitment to maintain specific performance and availability metrics for a service or system. |
| Containment            | Actions taken to limit the scope and impact of an incident, such as isolating affected systems or disabling compromised accounts. |
| Eradication            | The process of removing the root cause of an incident, including malware removal, patching vulnerabilities, or correcting misconfigurations. |
| Recovery               | Restoring systems and services to normal operation after an incident, ensuring integrity and availability are re-established. |
| Post-Incident Review   | A structured reflection and documentation process following incident resolution, used to identify lessons learned, update controls, and reinforce stewardship. |
| Runbook                | A predefined, markdown-based procedural guide for handling specific incident types, including detection, response, containment, and recovery steps. |
| Audit Artifact         | Any log, record, or documented action that supports traceability, accountability, and compliance during incident handling. |
| SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) | A system that aggregates and analyzes security-related data from across the environment to detect, alert, and support incident response. |

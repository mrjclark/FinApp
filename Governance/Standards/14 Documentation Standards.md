# Documentation Standards 

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This standard defines the minimum documentation requirements for FinAppâ€™s secure software development lifecycle, contributor onboarding, and audit traceability. It harmonizes NIST SSDF, OWASP ASVS, and CIS Controls into actionable, symbolic, and role-specific expectations. The intent is to foster stewardship, transparency, and resilience through modular, audit-ready documentation.

### 1.2 Scope
Applies to all FinApp systems, contributors, environments, and workflows that intersect with software development, security operations, and governance. Includes internal repositories, onboarding materials, contributor checklists, and control mappings.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Owner | Defines and enforces documentation standards. Reviews exceptions and ensures alignment with regulatory frameworks. |
| Contributors | Implement documentation tasks aligned to this standard. Escalate deviations and maintain traceability. |
| Auditors | Review documentation artifacts for completeness, control alignment, and contributor attestation. |
| Maintainers | Update templates, tags, and control mappings. Ensure versioning and review cycles are upheld. |

## 3. Standard Requirements

### 3.1 Minimum Documentation Artifacts
- Each SDLC phase must include documented inputs, outputs, and control mappings.
- All contributor-facing documents must include tags and control IDs.
- Version history must be maintained via Git or equivalent traceable system.

### 3.2 Contributor Checklists
- Onboarding checklists must include attestation to documentation standards.
- Role-specific tasks must be mapped to control IDs.

## 4. Implementation Guidance
- Use markdown-based templates for modularity and audit readiness.
- Embed control IDs from internal governance into headers and checklist items.

## 5. Exceptions
- Exceptions must be documented, risk-assessed, and approved by the standard owner.
- Reviewed at least annually.

## 6. Review & Maintenance
- Reviewed annually or upon significant changes to regulatory frameworks or FinApp architecture.
- Maintainers must log updates and tag revisions.

## 7. References
- NIST SP 800-218, SP 800-53 Rev 5, SP 800-30, SP 800-37  
- OWASP ASVS, Secure Coding Practices Guide  
- CIS Controls v8  
- ClarkSecOps Ritual Framework and Contributor Covenant  
- Internal FinApp governance repositories and onboarding materials

## 8. Audit & Traceability
- Compliance verified through periodic reviews of documentation artifacts.
- Contributors may be asked to attest via signed commits, checklist completion, or onboarding rituals.

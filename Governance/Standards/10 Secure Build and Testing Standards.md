# Secure Build and Testing Standards for FinApp

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 Purpose  
To define secure build and testing practices for FinApp that reduce software vulnerabilities, ensure audit traceability, and align with NIST and OWASP guidance. This standard supports contributor autonomy while reinforcing stewardship and regulatory compliance.

### 1.2 Scope  
Applies to all FinApp development environments, CI/CD pipelines, contributors, and third-party integrations involved in software build, testing, and release.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role          | Responsibilities                                                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Owner         | Maintains alignment with NIST SP 800-218 and OWASP WSTG. Approves exceptions.     |
| Contributors  | Implements secure build and test protocols. Documents deviations and test results.|

## 3. Standard Requirements

### 3.1 Secure Build Practices  
- Integrate security controls into CI/CD pipelines (SSDF Practice PO.3).  
- Use reproducible builds and verify integrity via hash validation.  

### 3.2 Secure Testing Protocols  
- Conduct static and dynamic analysis during build stages.  
- Validate against OWASP Top 10 risks (e.g., A01:2021 Broken Access Control).  

### 3.3 Vulnerability Management  
- Triage and remediate findings based on CVSS scores.  
- Document test coverage and results in version-controlled logs.  
- Require contributor attestation for critical releases.  

## 4. Implementation Guidance

- Use Git pre-commit hooks for static analysis  
- Automate test result uploads to FinApp’s audit repo

## 5. Exceptions

- Must be documented with rationale and risk assessment  
- Reviewed annually by the security steward

## 6. Review & Maintenance

- Reviewed annually or upon major SDLC changes  
- Maintainer logs updates via Git commit history

## 8. Audit & Traceability

- Compliance verified via build logs, test reports, and SBOMs  
- Contributors attest via signed commits and onboarding checklists

# Asset Management Policy

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
To define principles and requirements for the identification, classification, use, and protection of information assets within the FinApp project, ensuring their appropriate management in accordance with NIST SP 1800-5.

### 1.2 Scope
This policy applies to all information assets owned, controlled, or processed by the FinApp project, including but not limited to hardware, software, data, documentation, and cloud services. All project roles are covered.

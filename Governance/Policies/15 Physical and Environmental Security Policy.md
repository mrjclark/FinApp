# Physical and Environmental Security Policy

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
To define the principles and requirements for protecting physical assets and environments associated with the FinApp project, ensuring information security risks related to physical assets and their environments are managed appropriately and in accordance with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5.

### 1.2 Scope
This policy applies to all physical assets, facilities, and environments used by the FinApp project. As of this writing, no physical assets are owned or managed by the project. This policy will become effective and enforced should any physical assets be acquired or used in the future.

## 2. Policy Statement
The FinApp project is committed to ensuring the security of any future physical assets and environments by implementing controls to prevent unauthorized physical access, damage, or interference to its information and supporting infrastructure.

## 3. Policy Objectives
- Protect physical assets and facilities from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption.
- Restrict physical access to sensitive areas or assets to authorized personnel only.
- Securely store physical assets containing sensitive information and protect against environmental threats.
- Supervise and log all visitors or third parties requiring physical access.
- Implement appropriate environmental controls for the scale and criticality of assets.
- Establish secure disposal procedures for physical assets containing sensitive information.

# Incident Response Handling Policy

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
To define the principles and requirements for managing and responding to information security incidents within the FinApp project, ensuring an effective, consistent, and timely response aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST SP 800-51 Rev. 3.

### 1.2 Scope
This policy applies to all information security incidents that may affect the FinApp project, including but not limited to data breaches, system compromises, unauthorized access, and service disruptions. All project roles are covered.

## 2. Policy Statement
The FinApp project is committed to detecting, reporting, assessing, responding to, and learning from information security incidents to minimize impact and improve resilience. 

## 3. Policy Objectives
- Ensure all suspected or confirmed information security incidents are reported and documented promptly.
- Classify and assess incidents for impact and handle according to defined procedures.
- Take appropriate actions to contain, eradicate, and recover from incidents.
- Use lessons learned from incidents to improve controls and prevent recurrence.
- Manage communication regarding incidents to ensure accuracy, confidentiality, and compliance.
- Maintain readiness for incident response through preparation and training.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

| Roles                      | Responsibilities                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Incident Response Lead    | Coordinate incident response activities, manage playbooks, and oversee containment and recovery |
| System Owner              | Ensure systems are prepared for incident response and support containment and restoration efforts |
| Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst | Monitor systems, detect anomalies, and escalate incidents based on severity |
| Threat Intelligence Analyst | Analyze threat indicators, correlate external intelligence, and inform response strategy |
| Forensic Analyst          | Collect and preserve evidence, perform root cause analysis, and support legal or regulatory needs |
| IT Administrator          | Implement containment actions, restore systems, and apply patches or configuration changes |
| Legal Counsel             | Advise on breach notification, liability, and regulatory reporting obligations |
| Communications Officer    | Manage internal and external communications during incidents, including stakeholder updates |
| Privacy Officer           | Assess privacy impact of incidents involving PII and coordinate with legal and compliance teams |
| Compliance Officer        | Ensure incident handling aligns with regulatory requirements and document response activities |
| Human Resources           | Support personnel-related incidents and coordinate disciplinary or awareness actions if needed |
| Audit and Risk Officer    | Review incident trends, assess control effectiveness, and recommend improvements |
| Contributors / End Users  | Report suspicious activity, follow incident response procedures, and participate in post-incident reviews |


## 5. Incident Response Activities

### 5.1 Preparation

- Develop and maintain an Incident Response Plan (IRP) and playbooks  
- Establish and train a cross-functional Incident Response Team (IRT)  
- Conduct risk assessments and asset criticality mapping  
- Implement security controls (e.g., firewalls, EDR, MFA, SIEM)  
- Define escalation procedures and communication protocols  
- Build relationships with external partners (e.g., law enforcement, vendors)  
- Automate response thresholds and authority delegation  
- Conduct tabletop exercises and simulations  
- Maintain threat intelligence feeds and forensic readiness tools  
- Pre-authorize containment actions for rapid response  

### 5.2 Detection and Analysis

- Monitor systems using SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR, and log analysis  
- Identify precursors and indicators of compromise (IOCs)  
- Triage alerts and validate incidents (filter false positives)  
- Collect and preserve evidence (logs, disk images, memory dumps)  
- Analyze attack vectors, scope, and impact  
- Correlate internal findings with external threat intelligence  
- Classify incident severity and type (e.g., ransomware, data breach)  
- Notify stakeholders and initiate response protocols  
- Document incident timeline and affected assets  

### 5.3 Containment
- Isolate affected systems or networks  
- Apply short-term and long-term containment strategies  
- Quarantine malware and block attacker communication  
- Preserve evidence before making changes  

### 5.4 Eradication
- Remove malicious code, artifacts, and unauthorized access  
- Patch vulnerabilities and reconfigure systems  
- Validate that adversary access has been fully removed  

### 5.5 Recovery
- Restore systems from clean backups  
- Validate system integrity and monitor for reinfection  
- Resume operations with enhanced controls  
- Communicate recovery status to stakeholders  
- Document restoration steps and verification results  

### 5.6 Post-Incident Activity

- Conduct postmortem or after-action review  
- Reconstruct incident timeline and response actions  
- Perform root cause analysis (technical, procedural, human)  
- Evaluate team performance and training gaps  
- Document lessons learned and update IR plans  
- Share findings with stakeholders and external partners  
- Improve controls, playbooks, and detection capabilities  
- Retain evidence for legal, compliance, and audit purposes  
- Update threat models and risk assessments  

## 6. Exceptions
There will be no exceptions to policies. Policies will be upheld by all project members at all times.

## 7. Review & Maintenance
* Reviewed annually or upon significant changes.

# Continuity Policy

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
To define the principles and requirements for maintaining and restoring the availability of critical application functions and information in the FinApp project in the event of a disruption, in alignment with ISO/IEC 27001:2022.

### 1.2 Scope
This policy applies to all essential data, workflows, and components necessary to sustain or restore the operation of the FinApp application. All project roles are covered.

## 2. Policy Statement
The FinApp project is committed to ensuring the continuity of its core functions by identifying risks, preparing for disruptions, and implementing processes to recover and restore essential services and data within acceptable timeframes.

## 3. Policy Objectives
- Identify and prioritize essential application processes and data for continuity planning.
- Conduct impact analysis and risk assessments to determine continuity requirements.
- Develop, document, and maintain continuity and recovery plans.
- Regularly test, review, and update continuity and recovery plans.
- Assign and communicate roles and responsibilities for continuity and recovery activities.
- Use lessons learned from disruptions and exercises to improve continuity processes.

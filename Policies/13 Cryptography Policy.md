# Cryptography Policy

## 1. Purpose

To define the principles and requirements for the use, management, and protection of cryptographic controls within the FinApp project, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all data, systems, applications, and communications within the FinApp project where cryptographic measures are used to protect information.

## 3. Policy Statement

The FinApp project is committed to using appropriate cryptographic controls to protect sensitive and personal information from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.

## 4. Principles

- Cryptographic controls shall be applied to protect data at rest, in transit, and when required by law, regulation, or risk assessment.
- Only approved cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and key lengths shall be used, following recognized industry standards.
- Cryptographic keys shall be generated, stored, distributed, retired, and destroyed securely, in accordance with documented procedures.
- Private keys and passwords used for cryptographic purposes shall be kept confidential and protected against unauthorized access.
- The use of cryptography shall be regularly reviewed and updated to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
- Where encryption is not feasible, compensating controls must be implemented and documented.
- Legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements relating to the use of cryptography shall be identified and complied with.

## 5. Responsibilities

- The Application Owner is responsible for approving cryptographic methods, maintaining related documentation, and ensuring compliance with this policy.
- All contributors must adhere to established cryptographic practices and immediately report any suspected weaknesses or incidents.

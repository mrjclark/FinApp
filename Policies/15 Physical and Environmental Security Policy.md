- All visitors or third parties requiring physical access to project assets shall be supervised and logged.
- Environmental controls (such as fire alarms, climate control, and power protection) shall be implemented as appropriate for the scale and criticality of the asset.
- Secure disposal procedures shall be established for any physical assets that may contain sensitive information.

## 5. Responsibilities

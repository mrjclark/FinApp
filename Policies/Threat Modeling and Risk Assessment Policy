# Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment

## 1. Purpose & Scope
This document defines the threat modeling and risk assessment process for the Personal Finance App. The objective is to identify, analyze, and mitigate potential security risks, ensuring compliance with NIST SSDF and OWASP best practices.

Scope:
- Applies to all components of the application, including architecture, APIs, authentication mechanisms, and data flows.
- Uses OWASP Threat Dragon to visually model threats and vulnerabilities.

## 2. Threat Modeling Process

### 2.1 Methodology Overview
Threat modeling will be conducted using the STRIDE framework in OWASP Threat Dragon:
- Spoofing – Unauthorized identity access.
- Tampering – Data integrity violations.
- Repudiation – Lack of user accountability.
- Information Disclosure – Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Denial of Service – Disruption of application availability.
- Elevation of Privilege – Unauthorized access escalation.

### 2.2 Threat Modeling Steps
1. Define Application Scope and Assets – Identify critical application components and sensitive data.
2. Create Data Flow Diagrams – Map how data moves through the system.
3. Identify Threats and Weaknesses – Analyze threats using OWASP Threat Dragon.
4. Assign Risk Ratings – Evaluate risk using DREAD or CVSS scoring.
5. Recommend Mitigations – Suggest countermeasures and security controls.

## 3. Risk Assessment Framework

### 3.1 Framework 
The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) will be used to define structured risk assessment and mitigation processes. 

### 3.2 Risk Categorization
Risk levels will be assessed using an Impact vs. Likelihood Matrix. The scored result will determine priority.

### 3.3 Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Secure Coding Practices – Follow OWASP guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Access Control Policies – Enforce role-based access and least privilege.
- Encryption Standards – Implement AES for data at rest and TLS for data in transit.
- Security Testing Procedures – Conduct static, dynamic, and penetration testing.

## 4. Compliance and Documentation

### 4.1 Security Review Process
- Quarterly threat assessments to update models.
- Audit logs maintained for risk identification.
- Security requirements tracking linked to NIST SSDF.

### 4.2 Continuous Improvement
- Periodic security training for developers.
- Threat intelligence monitoring for emerging risks.

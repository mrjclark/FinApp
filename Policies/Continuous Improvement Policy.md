# Continuous Improvement and Version Control Policy

## 1. Purpose and Scope
This policy defines the approach for continuous improvement and version control within the Personal Finance App. It ensures structured development, efficient testing, and controlled deployment using GitHub.

Scope:
- Applies to all development updates, bug fixes, enhancements, and security patches.
- Covers version control strategy, branch management, and improvement tracking.

## 2. Continuous Improvement Strategy

### 2.1 Methodology
Continuous improvement is guided by:
- Regular code reviews and enhancements based on testing feedback.
- Performance optimization and security updates.
- Documentation of issues, resolutions, and feature requests.

### 2.2 Improvement Tracking
- Maintain a backlog of enhancements and fixes in GitHub Issues.
- Prioritize improvements based on impact and feasibility.
- Conduct periodic reviews to refine development focus.

## 3. Version Control Strategy

### 3.1 GitHub Branching Model
Development will follow a structured branching strategy:

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| master | Stable production-ready code. |
| testing | Pre-release validation for new changes. |
| development | Active development of new features or fixes. |

### 3.2 Workflow Process
1. Create a new development branch for each enhancement or fix.
2. Merge the completed development branch into testing for validation.
3. Conduct testing and resolve issues before merging into master.
4. Deploy only when testing is complete and code is verified.

### 3.3 Commit and Merge Guidelines
- Use descriptive commit messages following the convention: [Feature/Fix] Short Description.
- Ensure code reviews before merging into testing or master.
- Maintain a clean commit history for auditability.

## 4. Documentation and Review

### 4.1 Version Tracking
- Maintain a changelog documenting all updates and fixes.
- Tag releases in GitHub for historical reference.

### 4.2 Policy Updates
- Conduct quarterly reviews to refine branching workflows.
- Adapt version control strategies based on project needs.

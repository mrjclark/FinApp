# Configuration Management Policy

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
To define the principles and requirements for effective configuration management within the FinApp project, ensuring the integrity, consistency, and traceability of configurations in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022.

### 1.2 Scope
This policy applies to all configuration items, systems, applications, environments, and supporting documentation relevant to the FinApp project. All project roles are covered.

## 2. Policy Statement
The FinApp project is committed to maintaining secure and consistent configurations for all systems and software. Configuration management processes shall ensure that all changes are controlled, documented, and align with security and operational requirements.

## 3. Policy Objectives
- Identify, record, and maintain all configuration items in a controlled manner.
- Ensure configuration changes are subject to formal change control and approval.
- Define standard configurations and baselines, document deviations.
- Maintain and review configuration records and change histories regularly.
- Maintain backups of configuration data to support recovery and continuity.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

| Roles | Responsibilities |
|-------|------------------|
| Configuration Manager | - Develop and maintain the Configuration Management Plan <br> - oversee implementation and enforcement of configuration policies. |
| System Owner | - Approve baseline configurations and changes <br> - ensure configurations align with mission and risk tolerance. |
| Change Control Board (CCB) | - Review, approve, or reject proposed configuration changes <br> - ensure traceability and documentation. |
| Security Officer | - Validate that configurations meet security requirements <br> - monitor for unauthorized changes. |
| System Administrator | - Implement baseline configurations <br> - apply approved changes <br> - maintain configuration records. |
| Auditor | - Assess compliance with configuration policies <br> - verify change control and baseline integrity. |
| Developer | - Ensure code and build configurations align with secure baselines <br> - document configuration dependencies. |
| DevOps Engineer | - Automate configuration enforcement in CI/CD pipelines <br> - manage configuration-as-code artifacts. |
| Incident Responder | - Use configuration data to support investigation and recovery <br> - identify deviations contributing to incidents. |
| Configuration Analyst | - Perform impact analysis on proposed changes <br> - maintain inventory of configuration items and states. |


## 5. Configuration Management Activities

### 5.1 Baseline and Configuration Definition

- Define and maintain secure baseline configurations for systems, applications, and environments  
- Document configuration items, including version, dependencies, and ownership metadata  
- Maintain an inventory of configuration items and their current states across environments  
- Tag configuration items symbolically to reinforce stewardship, ownership, and audit traceability  

### 5.2 Change Control and Lifecycle Integration

- Implement configuration change control procedures, including approval workflows and rollback plans  
- Conduct impact analysis for proposed configuration changes, assessing security and operational effects  
- Integrate configuration management into system development and deployment lifecycles  
- Coordinate configuration decisions across roles (e.g., system owners, developers, security officers)  

### 5.3 Automation and Enforcement

- Automate configuration enforcement using scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or configuration-as-code tools  
- Monitor configurations for unauthorized changes or drift from approved baselines  
- Validate configuration settings against compliance industry standard checklists  
- Manage environment secrets and credentials securely, including rotation and access control  

### 5.4 Auditing and Incident Support

- Perform regular audits and reviews of configuration data and change logs  
- Support incident response and recovery using accurate configuration records  

### 5.5 Backup and Recovery

- Create and maintain regular backups of configuration data, including baseline files, secrets (in encrypted form), and change logs  
- Store configuration backups securely, with access controls and encryption appropriate to sensitivity  
- Automate backup processes for configuration-as-code repositories and environment settings  
- Validate backup integrity and test restoration procedures periodically  
- Retain historical configuration states to support audits, rollback, and incident investigations  
- Tag backup to indicate origin and purpose  

## 5. Exceptions
There will be no exceptions to policies. Policies will be upheld by all project members at all times.

## 6. Review & Maintenance
* Reviewed annually or upon significant changes.

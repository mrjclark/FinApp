# Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment Policy

## 1. Purpose

To establish a consistent and effective approach for identifying, assessing, treating, and monitoring information security risks throughout the FinApp project lifecycle, in line with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requirements.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all information assets, technology components, development activities, and supporting processes within the FinApp project.

## 3. Policy Statement

FinApp is committed to proactively identifying and managing risks that may impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information assets and services. Threat modeling and risk assessment are integral to the secure software development lifecycle and ongoing project management.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                   | Responsibilities                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Owner**          | Approves risk assessment methodology, reviews outcomes, accepts residual risk. |
| **Lead Developer**         | Conducts threat modeling and risk assessments, documents results, implements controls. |
| **(Solo Operator Note)**   | Where roles are combined, the project owner fulfills all responsibilities and documents this as a compensating control. |

## 5. Risk Assessment Process

### 5.1 Identification

- Identify assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts at each SDLC stage and for any significant change.
- Use industry-recognized frameworks.

### 5.2 Assessment

- Evaluate risks based on likelihood and impact (qualitative/semi-quantitative as appropriate).
- Document risks in a risk register, including owner and mitigation status.

### 5.3 Risk Treatment

- Determine appropriate treatment: mitigate, transfer, avoid, or accept.
- Select and implement controls based on risk level and business context.
- Document acceptance of residual risk by the project owner.

### 5.4 Monitoring and Review

- Review and update the risk register at least annually or upon significant project changes.
- Reassess risks after security incidents or major releases.
- Maintain records of all assessments, decisions, and implemented controls.

## 6. Reporting and Escalation

- All identified risks and treatment decisions are documented.
- Security incidents or new significant risks are reported to the project owner for review and response.

## 7. Policy Review

- This policy is reviewed annually or following significant changes to the project or threat landscape.

# Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) Governance Policy

## 1. Purpose & Scope
This policy establishes governance and oversight for the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) of the Personal Finance App. It ensures adherence to security best practices, risk mitigation, and compliance with industry standards such as NIST SSDF and OWASP.

**Scope:**
- Applies to all development stages: **Planning, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance**.
- Encompasses **risk management, secure coding, threat modeling, and compliance verification**.

## 2. Governance Structure
### Oversight Responsibilities
| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Security Steering Committee** | Defines security policies, reviews risks, and ensures compliance. |
| **Lead Developer** | Implements secure coding practices, oversees security assessments. |
| **Security Auditor** | Conducts vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and compliance checks. |

### SSDLC Governance Approach
- Security must be integrated into every phase of development.
- Regular security reviews and automated testing are required.
- Compliance documentation must be maintained for audits.

## 3. Risk Management Framework
### Threat Identification & Mitigation
- Threat modeling must be performed at the design stage.
- Secure coding standards according to OWASP must be followed.
- Dependencies must be analyzed for vulnerabilities before integration.

### Incident Response & Reporting
- Define escalation procedures for security incidents and issues.
- Maintain a security incident log for root cause analysis.
- Implement continuous monitoring and alerting for threats.

## 4. Compliance & Security Controls
### Code Quality & Testing
- Enforce secure code reviews, static analysis, and penetration testing.
- Require continuous security assessments before deployment.

### Access Control & Data Protection
- Apply role-based access control and least privilege principles.
- Ensure encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Adhere to privacy regulations, primarily GDPR.

## 5. Continuous Improvement
### Security Awareness & Training
- Developers must complete secure coding training annually.
- Security updates must be documented and reviewed periodically.

### Policy Review & Updates
- Conduct annual policy reviews to align with new threats.
- Update SSDLC governance based on emerging best practices.

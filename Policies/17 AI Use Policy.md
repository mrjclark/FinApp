# AI Use Policy
Document Status: Draft

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
To define the principles and requirements for the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the FinApp project, in accordance with ISO/IEC 42001:2023.

### 1.2 Scope
This policy applies to all interactions with AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI tools, in the context of the FinApp project.  
Note: At this time, AI LLMs are only consulted to assist in project development (e.g., code suggestions, documentation, design). No AI or machine learning capabilities are used within the FinApp application itself.

## 2. Policy Statement
The FinApp project is committed to ensuring the ethical, secure, and responsible use of AI, aligning with ISO/IEC 42001:2023 for AI governance and risk management. All AI systems or tools consulted during development must be used with transparency and integrity, with a clear distinction between tool-assisted development and application functionality.

## 3. Policy Objectives
- Ensure transparency and documentation of all AI use in development.
- Promote ethical use of AI, respecting privacy, copyright, and legal standards.
- Prevent sharing of sensitive or personal data with external AI systems or LLMs.
- Require human oversight and approval of all AI-assisted outputs before integration.
- Prohibit embedded AI or machine learning features in the application unless a risk assessment is completed.
- Conduct risk assessments prior to any future AI integration, considering security, bias, reliability, and compliance.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role           | Responsibilities                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Owner  | Ensures all AI use aligns with this policy, reviews changes in AI use, and maintains documentation. |
| Contributors   | Adhere to this policy when consulting or using AI tools, report concerns or breaches. |

## 5. AI Use Activities

### 5.1 Documentation and Transparency
- Document and disclose all use of AI in project records.

### 5.2 Ethical and Secure Use
- Use AI tools ethically, respecting privacy, copyright, and legal standards.
- Do not share sensitive or personal data with external AI systems.

### 5.3 Human Oversight
- Review and approve all AI-assisted outputs before integration.

### 5.4 Risk Assessment and Change Management
- Conduct risk assessments before integrating AI capabilities into the application.
- Update this policy if the status of AI use changes.

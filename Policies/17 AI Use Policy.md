# AI Use Policy

## 1. Purpose

To define the principles and requirements for the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the FinApp project, in accordance with the recommendations set out by ISO/IEC 42001.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all interactions with AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI tools, in the context of the FinApp project.  
Note: At this time, AI LLMs are only consulted to assist in project development (e.g., code suggestions, documentation, design). No AI or machine learning capabilities are used within the FinApp application itself.

## 3. Policy Statement

The FinApp project is committed to ensuring the ethical, secure, and responsible use of AI, aligning with international standards for AI governance and risk management. All AI systems or tools consulted during development must be used with transparency and integrity, with a clear distinction between tool-assisted development and application functionality.

## 4. Principles

- Transparency: Any use of AI in development must be documented and disclosed in project records.
- Ethical Use: AI tools must be used ethically, respecting privacy, copyright, and legal standards. Sensitive or personal data must not be shared with external AI systems or LLMs.
- Human Oversight: All outputs from AI-assisted development must be reviewed and approved by a human well versed on the input subject matter before integration into the project.
- No Embedded AI: The FinApp application does not currently use or offer any AI or machine learning features to users. This policy will be updated if this status changes.
- Risk Assessment: Any decision to incorporate AI capabilities into the FinApp application in the future will be preceded by a risk assessment, including considerations for security, bias, reliability, and compliance.

## 5. Responsibilities

- The Project Owner is responsible for ensuring that all use of AI in development aligns with this policy and for reviewing any changes in AI use.
- All contributors must adhere to this policy when consulting or using AI tools and must report any concerns or breaches.

# Software Development Security Charter

## 1. Purpose & Scope
### 1.1 Purpose
This charter defines the security principles and commitments guiding the development of the Personal Finance App. The objective is to implement a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) based on the NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### 1.2 Scope
- Applies to all phases of development: **Planning, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance**.
- Covers security **principles, roles, governance, risk management, and compliance**.

## 2. Security Commitments
### 2.1 Secure Development Framework
- Adhere to NIST SSDF guidelines as the primary framework.
- Implement OWASP secure coding principles.
- Conduct threat modeling and security assessments at key development phases.
- Maintain compliance with data privacy regulations primarily GDPR.

### 2.2 Secure Architecture & Design
- Follow a zero-trust model for authentication and access controls.
- Implement encryption standards (AES for data at rest, TLS for data in transit).
- Reduce attack surfaces using least privilege access control.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities
### 3.1 Project Roles
| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Lead Developer** | Oversee secure development practices, architecture, and documentation. |
| **Security Reviewer** | Perform code audits, vulnerability scans, and compliance checks. |
| **Incident Response Handler** | Define recovery strategies in case of security breaches. |

## 4. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
### 4.1 Planning & Design
- Identify security risks and define mitigation strategies.
- Establish secure coding guidelines.

### 4.2 Implementation
- Enforce input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Secure API interactions with authentication and authorization.

### 4.3 Testing
- Perform static and dynamic analysis to detect vulnerabilities.
- Implement penetration testing for security validation.

### 4.4 Deployment & Maintenance
- Monitor for vulnerabilities using automated scanning tools.
- Apply patch management and updates to mitigate risks.

## 5. Compliance & Continuous Improvement
### 5.1 Compliance Standards
- Document adherence to SSDF security requirements.
- Maintain audit logs for development activities.

### 5.2 Continuous Security Improvement
- Conduct periodic security assessments.
- Update security policies based on emerging threats.
